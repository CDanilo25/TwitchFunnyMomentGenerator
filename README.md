# The Funny Generator
This tool will help you to create some funny moments with your favorite Twitch streamer!

A great tool for a lazy freebooter!

## How it works
This tool works with Python 3 and some libraries listed in the REQUIREMENTS.TXT file.
You can create a Virtual Environment and install all the libraries if you want to.

FFMPEG is bundled in the project if you have Windows and it must be on the main location, otherwise you have to make sure to have it installed in your PATH.

You can generate a clip compilation with the latest clip from your Streamer or the latest video.
In the latter case, a random moment will be picked to generate the most funny video as humanly possible.

## Requirements
This tool use FFMPEG and MoviePY to generate fresh new content. You must have a working internet connection and some
disk space in order to save VODs and Clips. Everything will be cleaned up after the job is done.
